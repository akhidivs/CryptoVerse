## Other Details

- I'm using MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017) which only supports Xcode 14 and not the latest version of Xcode and Swift
- Covered networking part in detail which can be easily scaled to add any new features.
- Didn't used any third party libraries. Although we can use Material components for the bottom filters but I've tried creating a custom filter view using Collection View.
